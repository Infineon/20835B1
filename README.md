# BTSDK - CYW20835

## Overview

The Infineon CYW20835 is an ultra-low-power Bluetooth Low Energy 5.2 wireless MCU device. It has a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting LE.  BR/EDR is not supported.

## SDK Software Features
- Dual mode Bluetooth stack included in the ROM (BR/EDR/LE).
- BT stack and profile level APIs for embedded BT application development.
- WICED HCI protocol to simplify host/MCU application development.
- APIs and drivers to access on board peripherals.
- Bluetooth protocols include GAP, GATT, SMP, RFCOMM, SDP.
- LE and BR profile APIs, libraries, and sample apps.
- Documentation for APIs, datasheet, profiles and features.

## Kits Supported
